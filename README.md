# 🧩 BudgetBuddy

## 📘 Project Description
BudgetBuddy is a personal expense tracking application designed to help students and young professionals manage their finances effectively. Users can log transactions, categorize expenses, set monthly budgets, and visualize their spending patterns through interactive charts. Built with React, Node.js/Express, and MongoDB, this app provides a simple yet powerful solution for staying on top of your money.

## 🚀 Features

### 🧠 Feature 1: *Transaction Management*
**Description:**
Users can add, edit, and delete transactions with details like amount, category (food, transport, entertainment, etc.), date, and optional notes. All transactions are stored in a MongoDB database and displayed in a sortable, filterable list. This core CRUD functionality forms the foundation of the app's data management.

### ⚙️ Feature 2: *Budget Tracking and Alerts*
**Description:**
Users can set monthly budget limits for different spending categories. The app calculates total spending per category and displays progress bars showing how much of the budget has been used. When users approach or exceed their budget (e.g., 90% threshold), visual alerts appear to encourage better spending habits.
